Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) represent a paradigm shift in AI development where multiple specialized AI agents collaborate to solve complex tasks. This approach has gained traction with the emergence of frameworks like [LangGraph](/frameworks/langgraph/), AutoGen, [llama-agents](/frameworks/llamaindex/) and CrewAI.

See also: [Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication](/architecture-pattern/a2a/), which explores how agents interact and coordinate within multi-agent systems.


## Key Concepts

- **Specialized Roles**: Each agent can be optimized for specific tasks
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Agents work together to tackle complex challenges
- **State Management**: Shared context and memory across agent interactions
- **Flexible Architecture**: Support for various communication patterns and workflows
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Integration of human feedback and oversight
- **Scalable Design**: Ability to add or modify agents as needed

## Recommendations

For simpler applications, single-agent solutions are often appropriate and easier to maintain. We recommend to maximize and optimize the "single agent" first.

When the complexity of the application exceeds the capabilities of a single agent, a Multi-Agent System can be a more effective approach. For example, a single agent might struggle with very complex instructions or may not always pick the right tool (tool overload) for the job.

Benefits:

- provides intuitive separation of concepts in your architecture
- allows optimzing the individual agents
- allows reuse of agents (composable architecture)
- can improve overall performance and scalability

So consider Multi-Agent Systems when building complex AI applications that require:

- Division of tasks among specialized components
- Sophisticated decision-making processes
- Real-time collaboration between AI agents
- Integration of human oversight
- To avoid "Tool overload" for single agents

## Orchestration Pattern

- "Manager"-"Worker" architecture: A manager coordinates the work of multiple connected agents.
- Decentralized architecture: Agents act as "Peers", that may coordinate or pass over tasks to other agents.

## Integration

Multi-Agent Systems can be implemented using various frameworks:

- [LangGraph](/frameworks/langgraph/) for graph-based workflows
- AutoGen for dynamic conversations
- [CrewAI](/frameworks/crew-ai/) for role-based task delegation
- [llama-agents](/frameworks/llamaindex/)
- [n8n](/tools/n8n/)
