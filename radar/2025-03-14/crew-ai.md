CrewAI is an open‑source, MIT‑licensed Python framework for orchestrating autonomous, role-playing AI agents in collaborative teams called "Crews", independent of external frameworks like LangChain. It emphasizes high performance, low latency, and fine-grained control for enterprise-grade automation

## Core Concept

- Agents: LLM-powered roles with goals and tools.
- Crews: Teams of agents working on a shared task.
- Flows: Deterministic task orchestration, supporting sequences, conditions, and parallelism.
- Tools: Reusable actions (e.g., web scraping, file ops) injected into agents at runtime.
