STACKIT Model Serving (Beta) is a managed platform for deploying large language models (LLMs) such as Llama 3.1 within a data-sovereign, GDPR-compliant European cloud environment. Developed by STACKIT, the cloud division of the Schwarz Group, the service emphasizes secure and compliant AI integration for enterprises operating in regulated sectors.

## Key Features

  All data processing occurs within STACKIT's German data centers, ensuring compliance with European data protection standards. User data and prompts are neither stored nor utilized for model training purposes.

- **API-Based Integration**:  
  The platform offers straightforward API access to selected open-source LLMs

- **Flexible Billing**:  
  A token-based billing system (scaling aligned with usage patterns).
