LangGraph extends [LangChain](/frameworks/langchain/)'s capabilities by providing structured ways to manage complex workflows and agent interactions through a graph-based approach.

## Key Features

### Graph-Based Workflows

Implements directed graph architecture with robust state management and event handling. Supports conditional branching and parallel execution for complex workflows.

### Multi-Agent System

Allows to implement multi-agent systems. For examples check out the [LangChain blogpost on multi-agent workflows](https://blog.langchain.dev/langgraph-multi-agent-workflows/)

### Development Tools

Features visual graph rendering. [See Visualize your graph section:](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/graph-api/#visualize-your-graph)
