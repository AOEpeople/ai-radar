## Trends

- **Agentic AI:** Models improve in autonomously planning, useing tools, and perform multi-step workflows 
- **Multimodal Integration:** Unified handling of text, images, audio, and video for richer interaction and analysis  
- **Efficiency:** Smaller models like o4-mini deliver strong results with lower compute and faster inference
