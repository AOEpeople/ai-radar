Kotaemon is an open‑source, self‑hostable RAG-based platform offering document‑centric chat and QA. It caters to both non‑technical end users and developers seeking to build or demo document question‑answering workflows via a customizable Gradio UI. 

For developers it provides a good demo on different RAG patterns.

## Features
- Hybrid retrieval pipeline combining full-text and vector search, with re-ranking for higher relevance. Low‑confidence retrieval results are flagged.
- Multi-modal document support, including tables and figures, with citation previews directly in-browser. Highlighted text snippets are shown in citations. 
- Advanced reasoning support, including question decomposition and agent‑style chains (e.g. ReAct, ReWOO) for complex queries.
- Integration of GraphRAG
