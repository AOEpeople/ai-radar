Browser Use is an open-source Python framework that enables LLM-driven browser automation using Playwright. It allows agents to interact with websites through high-level instructions (e.g., “log in and download report”) instead of brittle selectors. It supports OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, and local models via Ollama.

## Key features:

- Agent-based API: Define tasks using natural language; LLMs generate browser commands.
- Playwright backend: Cross-browser support, headless or visible.
- MCP integration: Extensible via Model Context Protocol for tool orchestration.
- Web UI & CLI: Interactive interface for testing agent workflows.


Browser Use is under active development and best suited for prototyping AI agents that need to navigate or extract data from websites.
