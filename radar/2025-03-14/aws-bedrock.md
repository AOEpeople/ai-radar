AWS Bedrock is a fully managed service that provides easy access to foundation models from leading AI companies through a unified API. It enables developers to build and scale generative AI applications without the complexity of directly managing model infrastructure.

## Key Features

- Access to diverse foundation models from industry leaders like Anthropic (Claude), AI21 Labs, Cohere, Meta, and Amazon
- Unified API with comprehensive SDKs (Python, Java, JavaScript)
- Enterprise-grade security with private endpoints and AWS IAM integration
- Model customization through fine-tuning and RAG capabilities
- Bedrock Agents for building custom AI assistants with business logic and data access
- Knowledge Bases for efficient information retrieval and context augmentation

## Our Take

AWS Bedrock stands out as a compelling enterprise AI platform, particularly for organizations prioritizing data privacy and security compliance. The service excels in providing:

- A single access point to multiple leading AI models
- Enterprise-grade security and governance
- Seamless integration with existing AWS services
- Low effort model experimentation and deployment

The ability to switch between models through a unified API allows teams to optimize for performance, cost, and specific use cases without significant infrastructure changes.

## Recommendations

- Start with a model evaluation phase to identify the best fit for your use case ([see Model Discovery & Selection](/models-platforms/model_discovery/))
- Implement proper IAM roles and security best practices from day one
- Monitor costs carefully and use model-specific pricing calculators
- Consider using Bedrock Agents for building custom AI assistants
- If you are not already using AWS, consider that onboarding and integration may be more complex; alternatives with lower hurdles include [OpenAI (Azure OpenAI)](/models-platforms/azure_openai/), [Hugging Face](/models-platforms/huggingface/), or [Replicate.ai](/models-platforms/replicate/).
