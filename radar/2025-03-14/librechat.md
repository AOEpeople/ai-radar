LibreChat is an open-source project that provides a feature-rich, ChatGPT-style user interface focused on extensibility, API compatibility, and local control.

Similar to [OpenWebUI](/tools/openweb_ui/) it offers a customizable user interface and can be self-hosted, ensuring data privacy and full control over the dataflow. An active community drives continuous development and new features.

## Architecture and Use Cases

LibreChat is built on a Node.js backend stack (Express, MongoDB) with a React frontend. 
Conversation data is persisted and searchable.

## Features

* Supported different LLM backends (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, OpenRouter, LocalAI, etc.)
* Tool integrations for file uploads, web search, code interpreter
* Speech support
* Extendable (Agents, Plugins)
* ...
