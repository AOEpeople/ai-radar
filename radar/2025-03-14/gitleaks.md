[Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) is a SAST tool for detecting hardcoded secrets in Git repositories. It integrates cleanly into development workflows via pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipelines. Rules are defined using TOML files, allowing flexible regular expression patterns and contextual matching â€” including organization-specific configurations.

**Recommendation**: Embed Gitleaks into CI pipelines for any codebase involving LLMs or external APIs. Maintain custom rules and update detection patterns regularly to minimize false positives and blind spots.
