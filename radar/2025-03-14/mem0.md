Mem0 is an open-source memory engine designed to add structured, long-term recall to AI agents. It integrates with existing LLM stacks without replacing retrievers or planners. 




ðŸ”§ Core Concepts
* Multi-Level Memory: Seamlessly retains User, Session, and Agent state with adaptive personalization
* Hybrid Data Architecture: Utilizes vector, keyâ€‘value, and optional graph stores for efficient fact retrieval and relational context. 
* Extraction & Update Pipeline: LLM-driven summarization extracts salient conversational facts; update logic (add/update/delete/noâ€‘op) keeps memory coherent and lean.
