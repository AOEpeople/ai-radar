The Vercel AI SDK is a TypeScript-first toolkit for building AI-driven interfaces in React, Next.js, Svelte, Vue, and Node.js. It abstracts over major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Cohere, Ollama) and supports streaming, tool calling, and structured output generation.

It is suitable for integrating chat UIs, autocomplete, and tool-augmented agents into web apps.
