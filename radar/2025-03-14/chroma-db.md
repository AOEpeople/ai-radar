Chroma DB is commonly used for retrieval-augmented generation, semantic search, and vector-based knowledge management in AI applications.

## Integration

Chroma DB integrates seamlessly with popular LLM frameworks like [LangGraph](/frameworks/langgraph/) and [LlamaIndex](/frameworks/llamaindex/)

## Recommendations

Consider Chroma DB when you need a lightweight, easy-to-deploy vector database with strong Python support. It's particularly well-suited for rapid prototyping and smaller to medium-scale applications.
You might want to evaluate alternatives like Weaviate or Milvus.
