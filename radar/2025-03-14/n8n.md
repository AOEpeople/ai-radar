n8n is an extensible workflow automation platform supporting low-code orchestration across APIs, services, and AI systems. It offers a node-based visual builder and supports custom scripting, making it suitable for engineering-grade automation.

n8n supports both cloud-based and self-hosted deployments. n8n has two licenses: a "Sustainable Use License" which allows the use for internal use cases, and an enterprise license offering enterprise features.

## Key Features

### Visual Workflow Design

n8n's visual flow builder provides intuitive workflow creation through node-based architecture, with  conditional logic and error handling. Data transformation nodes and trigger types (webhook, polling, schedule) make it suitable for real-time and batch use cases.

The visual approach also enables domain experts to create or co-create AI workflows, which closes the gap between AI engineers and domain experts.

### AI Integration

The platform offers direct LLM API connections and custom AI node support, including flexible model integration options.

n8n provides a built-in *AI Agent* nodes that integrates, allowing for the creation of agents capable of tool usage, memory management, and decision-making processes

Agents can be chained, monitored, and triggered programmatically, making n8n a viable control layer for AI-driven systems and workflows.

### pre-built integrations

With over 400 pre-built integrations, including popular saas tools and support for vector databases like Pinecone and Qdrant, n8n facilitates the rapid development of AI applications and workflows

### Extensibility and Custom Nodes

Custom JavaScript functions and community-contributed nodes expand integration capabilities. Engineers can implement proprietary API calls or services not covered by out-of-the-box connectors.


### Enterprise Features

For the enterprise version the platform comes with:

- SSO connection and role-based access control
- Additional observability features (logging, data retention)
- High availability options and scalability features
- Professional versioning and deployment features

These features support deployment in regulated or large-scale environments.

## Use Cases

- Workflow automation - including workflows which require AI capabilities
- Building data processing pipelines
- Orchestrating multi-step AI workflows (e.g., RAG pipelines, agentic tools)
- Cross-platform API integration for enterprise SaaS environments
- ...

The n8n website contains a repository of community-contributed use-cases.


## Engineering Recommendations

- Focus on designing modular, reusable workflows with comprehensive error handling. E.g. structure workflows into reusable sub-flows with clear input/output contracts.
- Regular validation of data at key points ensures reliability
- Use the [Execution Logs](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/logging/) and error nodes to manage failures gracefully.
- Monitor agent behavior and token usage when integrating LLMs to avoid runaway costs.
- Store sensitive credentials using the supported credential manager and restrict access via RBAC.

## Deployment

- **Self-hosted**: Supports containerized deployment via Docker or Kubernetes. Suitable for teams with infrastructure control needs or data compliance requirements.
- **Cloud**: Managed by n8n.io with automated updates, backups, and SLA-based support.
